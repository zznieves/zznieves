# Hi, I'm Zayon Nieves

<p>I am a passionate <b>software engineer</b> who is fascinated by the boundless potential of technology and its profound impact on shaping our world. As Arthur C. Clarke famously said, <b>'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.'</b> The ability to take an idea and bring it to life through technology truly feels like magic to me. I thrive on building innovative projects and collaborating with others to turn creative visions into reality.</p>
